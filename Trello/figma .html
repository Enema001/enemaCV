			<q><i>The survival, growth, development and participation are the rights of every child, to protect and fulfill these rights, budgets, laws and social policies that promote equity are required.</q></i>

			Nigeria is beset by high levels of disparity in terms of access to social services and income distribution. Disparities are socio-economic – linked among others to types of employment and levels of education of the parents– as well as geographic, mainly <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">between North and South and between rural and urban areas. Gender inequality is pervasive in Nigeria, in terms of political representation, access to and control over land, credit facilities, technologies, education and health. Large numbers of people live in poverty, both monetary and multidimensional.
			Design and implement more effective and equitable policies and interventions to help realize the rights of all children, and help monitor their impact.

			Ensure that public finance delivers results for children, through effective, equitable and child-focused social sector planning and spending.
			Build local capacity and strengthen community participation to promote inclusiveness and avoid discrimination.</span></p>

			Food is one of the basic needs of every human. One of the major cause of increased crimes in Africa is hunger.

			In line with the government policy on school feeding programme through which over 10 millions pupils have been fed by the government, the HelpAChild Foundation will partner with the necessary agencies of the government, donors and NGOs to ensure that quality foods are distributed to school children or children involved in any form of abuse.

		<h3>Child Development</h3>

			<h4>End Open defecation</h4>

			According to UNICEF, there has been a decline in the number of people practicing open defecation (OD) in rural Nigeria, from 35.7 per cent in 2015 to 32.4 per cent in 2017. It is estimated that OD will still be practiced by one in five Nigerians living in rural areas by 2025
			<h4>Solution</h4>
			HelpAChild Foundation in partnership with other government agencies and donors will enhance strategic planning and dialogue that leads to collective problem identification, goal-setting, decision making, community-based implementation and evaluation of solutions to several issues related to child survival, development, protection and participation.

			Encouraging community members to construct improved household latrines and promoting sanitation as a responsible social enterprise.

			Providing strong and essential support in emergencies including social mobilization for prevention and treatment following disease outbreaks.

			<h4>Basic Education</h4>
			Since the start of the Boko Haram conflict in 2009, more than 2,295 teachers have been killed, 19,000 others have been displaced and 1,400 schools have been destroyed. HelpAChild Foundation believes the attacks on schools are in danger of creating a lost generation of children, threatening their future and that of the country.
			We will ensure that children are given basic education in all their displacement camps to complement the government efforts in such regions.

		<h3>Education</h3>

			One in every five of the world’s out-of-school children is in Nigeria.

			Although primary education is free and compulsory in some states in Nigeria, over 10.5 million children aged between 10-14 years are not in school. Only 61% regularly attend school and only 36% of children between the ages of 3-4 years receive early child education.
			In the north of the country, the picture is even bleaker, with a net attendance rate of 53 percent. Getting out-of-school children back into education poses a massive challenge.
			Gender, like geography and poverty, is an important factor in the pattern of educational marginalization. States in the north-east and north-west have female primary net attendance rates of 47.7 percent and 47.3 percent, respectively, meaning that more than half of the girls are not in school. The education deprivation in northern Nigeria is driven by various factors, including economic barriers and socio-cultural norms and practices that discourage attendance in formal education, especially for girls.

				The protracted conflict in north-eastern Nigeria continues to devastate the lives of civilians, resulting in a humanitarian crisis affecting 7.7 million women, men and children who are all in acute need of help and protection. Since the start of the conflict in 2009, more than 20,000 people have been killed, more than 4,000 people abducted and 1.7 million remain displaced, most of them in Borno State.
				<br>
				Some of our emergency responses include; treatment of severe acute malnourished (SAM) children via therapeutic programmes, provision of multi-micronutrient supplements and counselling for caregivers on appropriate infant feeding.
				Provide support to the State Primary Health Care Development Agency (SPHCDA) to set up outreach sites in Borno and Yobe States.
				Establishment of mobile teams in Borno State providing integrated nutrition services to children and families.
				Provision of primary healthcare consultations, vaccination against measles for children and provision of insecticide treated bed-nets for families.
				Provision of access to safe water, improved sanitation facilities and hygiene promotion, and distribution of hygiene supplies to maintain a sanitary environment.

				Provision of psychosocial support and reintegration services to children associated with armed groups or subject to sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV), and linking unaccompanied and separated children to protective services.
